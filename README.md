# CS224D Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing - Exercises

Hey!

If you are here, you are probably searching for some second thought in the [cs224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/)
and I hope I can help you.
If you have no idea how you should run them, access the link above and search the problem sets materials that you will
find out.

Some results (accuracies) in the third assignment:

One-Layer RNN:

* wvecDim = 5 : 0.740343088764;
* wvecDim = 15: 0.766135064058;
* wvecDim = 25: 0.793929596835;
* wvecDim = 30: 0.796149299105;
* wvecDim = 35: 0.801746809178;
* wvecDim = 45: 0.801505537192;

Two-Layer RNN (deep RNN2):

* wvecDim = 30, middleDim = 5 : 0.733490964364;
* wvecDim = 30, middleDim = 15: 0.765435375299;
* wvecDim = 30, middleDim = 25: 0.773421478032;
* wvecDim = 30, middleDim = 30: 0.768475402321;
* wvecDim = 30, middleDim = 35: 0.790937824209;
* wvecDim = 30, middleDim = 45: 0.794098487225;
